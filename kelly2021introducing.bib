abstract = {We designed and implemented an online module that explains accessibility to non-major high school students. The module demonstrates one of the important Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, known as Reflow, using hands-on experience. Reflow is a particularly essential feature for the accessibility of webpages for people with cognitive impairments. The module consists of an interactive lecture and engaging quizzes. We held an online one-hour workshop where the activity was presented to 52 high school students. We collected objective and subjective data about students' knowledge and learning experience using 3 questionnaires. Our findings indicate that the module is effective in raising students' awareness of disabilities, leveraging their knowledge on accessibility, and maintaining high interest in pursuing a computing degree.},
