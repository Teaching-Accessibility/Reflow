### Inaccessible vs Accessible Activity

The intent behind this activity is to demonstrate a website with faulty reflow design (the inaccessible page) and quiz the students on what information is on the page. Then, we will show the students the accessible page and quiz them again with the same quiz to show the change in answers now that they have the whole picture.

- Activity: [Inaccessible](https://teaching-accessibility.github.io/ReflowCC/Inaccessible/)
  - This activity lets you review an inaccessable website where reflow is the main issue
  - Script: The script for the Inaccessible site is found in the [directory as Inaccessible](Activity/Inaccessible)
- Quiz: [No-Reflow Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewwPAUNxfAi01pk-Zrf6rAuHOJQBRGjV5NPA9upT8CBF1Agw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  - This quiz asks students to answer questions about the page. While all the answers are on the page, some are obscured due to reflow issues.
- Activity: [Accessible](https://teaching-accessibility.github.io/ReflowCC/Accessible/)
  - This activity lets you review an accessable website where reflow issues addressed in the previous activity are removed.
  - Script: The script for the Accessible site is found in the [directory as Accessible](Activity/Accessible)
- Quiz: [Reflow Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA8AsXTVnk3ujFxpI7FBAXUXCCTEDPSEp2ZP5T2zGU2yWc0Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  - This quiz asks students to answer questions about the page. All answers are on the page and should now be easier to find.

### Reflow Lecture

The intent behind the lecture is to provide a modular teaching material that has the information pre-prepared for a presentation. To test that students learned the major points of the lecture, there is also a quiz.

- Slides: [Reflow-Slides](Lecture/Cognitive_Impairment_Activity.pptx)
  - Slides designed for ease of implementation in your own course
- Video: [Slides with Video]()
  - Generally the same content as the slides
- Quiz: [Reflow Lecture Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hUdHrl87FpNOUdn344dkLbCHCNk7jIs-s0nuOjeDNhc/edit)
  - This quiz asks students to answer questions based on the various topics discussed in the lecture pertaining to reflow

### Fixing the Inaccessible Website Activity

This activity is based off of the first activity and is intented to allow students a hands-on approach to fixing the inaccessible website. While the script for the accessible and inaccessible are both in the github, there are also step-by-step guides for fixing reflow ishes. The _The step-by-step fix the inaccessible website_ is intended to be the step-by-step guide to fixing the [Inaccessible vs Accessible Activity](#Inaccessible-vs-Accessible-Activity), and the _Generalized step-by-step fix the inaccessible website_ file is a more generalized aproach.

- Tutorial: [The step-by-step fix the inaccessible website](Activity/Step-by-Step-Fix/Step_by_Step_to_Fix_Inaccessible.pdf)
- Tutorial: [Generalized step-by-step fix the inaccessible website](Activity/Step-by-Step-Fix/Generalized_Step_by_Step_to_Fix_Inaccessible.pdf)
- Script: The [script for the Accessible site](Activity/Accessible)

### Case Study

This study is intented for students who are looking to further their understanding of what exactly Reflow is and to jump into the rabbit hole of what it can be used for.
